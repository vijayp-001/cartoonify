# cartoonify

Cartoonify Reality is an OpenCV project that uses core OpenCV functions and the K-Means clustering algorithm to perform image processing and cartoony them. This project shows how good image processing can be used to do the same task that normally takes a machine learning model and high computational power. Usually, the same task is done using either auto-encoders or GANs(Generative Adversarial Networks).
